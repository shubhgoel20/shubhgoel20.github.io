This course assignment's goal was to optimize the allocation of sports zones within a complex to minimize average walking time from one sports zone to another. We experimented with several search algorithms, including A*, local search, local search with random walks, enforced hill climbing and simulated annealing. We developed a heuristic to incorporate backtracking in local search with random walks and random restarts, significantly improving the algorithm's performance.
